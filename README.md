# SSB4 file format parsers

fmt_* modules all have the read() method which takes a file name and parsed contents.

To use nud2json.py, you'll have to go in and change the paths to your SSB4 data and the character to extract. This generates `model_test/model.json`, which you can preview in `model_test/index.html`
